-- Levels.lua

-- Level are organized in packs, each pack consists of 6 levels.
-- - Level definitions include;
-- - name: shows in the level chooser screen as well at at 
--     the top of the level. Also used to save solutions 
--     and score
-- - claw: the starting position of the claw (the pile 
--     number where it starts)
-- - stars: an array of two elems. The first is the max number 
--     of instructions allowed for 2 starts and the second, 
--     the max number of instructions allowed for 3 stars
-- - funcs: specifies the number of progs and the lenght of progs 
--     allowed in that level
-- - toolbox: specifies the tools available in that level
-- - stage/goal: specifies which crates are in which piles. 
--     By convention the first crate in each pile is the 
--     lowest crate in that pile
-- - hint: the hint string
